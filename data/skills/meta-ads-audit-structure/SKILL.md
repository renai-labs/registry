# Audit Structure

## How to Call Meta Ads Tools

Call the mounted `meta_ads_*` MCP tools directly. Do not write a Python wrapper.

Before each entity query, call `meta_ads_get_field_context` for every field used in `fields` or
`filtering`. Then call `meta_ads_get_ad_entities` with a numeric `ad_account_id`, a level of
`campaign`, `adset`, or `ad`, and a fields array containing `id` and `name`. Filtering values are
arrays of strings. Join parent names locally from `campaign_id` and `adset_id`.

## Purpose

Execute a structured campaign architecture audit for a Meta Ads account. This skill assesses whether the account follows the recommended simplified campaign model, identifies structural fragmentation that impairs Meta's learning algorithm, evaluates CBO vs ABO usage appropriateness, checks naming convention compliance for automated parsing, and evaluates Advantage+ Shopping Campaign (ASC) adoption. The output is a restructuring plan with implementation timeline.

## When to Use

- Account has >10 active campaigns and performance is inconsistent
- CPA rising and audit-bidding and analyze-creative found no clear cause (structure may be the bottleneck)
- Onboarding a new account (first audit to assess baseline structure)
- After a major strategy shift (new product, new market, new creative approach)
- When ad sets are stuck in "Learning Limited" across multiple campaigns
- When the account manager asks "should I consolidate?"

## Dependencies

| Skill | Why It's Needed |
|-------|----------------|
| [[meta-ads-account-conventions]] | Naming conventions, capability flags, campaign_types_active |
| [[meta-ads-campaign-structure-methodology]] | Three-campaign model, consolidation rules, ASC guidelines, CBO/ABO decision framework |
| [[meta-ads-account-maturity-methodology]] | Maturity determines structural complexity tolerance |

---

## Step 0: Load Dependencies

1. **Read [[meta-ads-account-conventions]]** and extract for the target account:
   - `ad_account_id`, `currency`, `timezone`
   - `kpi_config` (targets for learning phase viability assessment)
   - `naming_conventions` (campaign, ad_set, ad patterns and tokens)
   - `capabilities` (has_advantage_plus, has_catalog, campaign_types_active)
   - `maturity_level`
   - `monthly_conversion_volume` (critical for learning phase math)
   - `data_source.method`

2. **Read [[meta-ads-campaign-structure-methodology]]** and load:
   - Three-campaign model definition (Prospecting, Retargeting, ASC/Testing)
   - Maximum campaign count guidelines by maturity and spend
   - CBO vs ABO decision framework
   - Ad set consolidation rules (50 conversions/week minimum)
   - ASC structure best practices
   - Fragmentation detection criteria

3. **Read [[meta-ads-account-maturity-methodology]]** and determine:
   - Recommended structural complexity:
     - **Nascent:** 1-2 campaigns, CBO, broad targeting, minimal ad sets
     - **Developing:** 2-4 campaigns, CBO primary, introduce retargeting
     - **Established:** 3-6 campaigns, mix of CBO/ABO, full funnel
     - **Advanced:** 5-10 campaigns, sophisticated structure, ASC + manual hybrid

**Validation gate:** If `ad_account_id` is missing, stop. If `naming_conventions` are not configured, the naming audit step will be limited (flag this to the user).

4. Ad set-level performance, last 7 days

---

## Step 2: Structure Assessment

### Account Inventory

Build a complete structural map:

```
Account: {name} ({ad_account_id})
Active Campaigns: {count}
Paused Campaigns: {count}
Active Ad Sets: {count} (across all campaigns)
Active Ads: {count} (across all ad sets)

Campaign Breakdown by Objective:
- Conversions: {count} campaigns
- Traffic: {count}
- Reach/Awareness: {count}
- Video Views: {count}
- Lead Gen: {count}
- Catalog Sales: {count}
- App Install: {count}
```

### Fragmentation Detection

**Campaign-level fragmentation:**

| Signal | Threshold | Classification |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| >5 active campaigns with same objective | Any | Heavy fragmentation |
| >3 active campaigns with same objective | Nascent/Developing | Moderate fragmentation |
| >8 total active campaigns | Developing or below | Overly complex |
| >15 total active campaigns | Any maturity | Excessive -- likely needs major restructure |

**Ad set-level fragmentation:**

| Signal | Threshold | Classification |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| >5 ad sets per campaign (CBO) | Any | Budget dilution risk |
| >8 ad sets per campaign (ABO) | Any | Management overhead |
| <50 weekly conversions per ad set | Any | Learning Limited risk |
| Ad sets with <$10/day effective budget | Any | Too small to learn |

**Ad-level issues:**

| Signal | Threshold | Classification |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| >20 active ads per ad set | Any | Creative noise (Meta can't test efficiently) |
| 1 ad per ad set | Any | No testing or optimization happening |
| Mix of very old + very new ads | Age gap >90 days | Creative hodgepodge |

### Ideal Structure Comparison

Compare actual structure to the recommended model for the account's maturity:

```
Recommended (Developing Account, $3K/day):
├── Campaign 1: Prospecting (CBO, $2,000/day)
│   ├── Ad Set: Broad (2-3 ads)
│   └── Ad Set: LAL 1-3% LTV (2-3 ads)
├── Campaign 2: Retargeting (CBO, $500/day)
│   ├── Ad Set: Website Visitors 30d (2-3 ads)
│   └── Ad Set: Engaged Users (2-3 ads)
└── Campaign 3: Testing (ABO, $500/day)
    ├── Ad Set: Test Theme A ($150/day, 3-5 ads)
    ├── Ad Set: Test Theme B ($150/day, 3-5 ads)
    └── Ad Set: Test Theme C ($200/day, 3-5 ads)

Actual:
├── {actual structure map}
```

Highlight deviations: missing campaigns, excess campaigns, misallocated budgets.

## Step 3: CBO vs ABO Audit

### Current Usage

| Campaign | Budget Type | Daily Budget | Ad Set Count | Conversions/Week |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| ...      | CBO       | $500        | 4           | 120             |
| ...      | ABO       | N/A (ad set level) | 3    | 45              |

### CBO Appropriateness

CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) is recommended when:
- Campaign has 2-5 ad sets with similar optimization goals
- Total campaign conversions >50/week (algorithm has enough signal to distribute)
- You trust Meta to allocate between ad sets

CBO is NOT recommended when:
- Ad sets have very different audience sizes (Meta will over-index on the largest)
- You need precise per-audience budget control (e.g., retargeting must stay at exactly $200/day)
- Campaign has only 1 ad set (CBO adds no value)

### ABO Appropriateness

ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization) is recommended when:
- Testing campaigns (need equal budget distribution across tests)
- Retargeting with specific budget requirements per funnel stage
- Campaign has ad sets with very different audience sizes or value

### Misfit Detection

| Scenario | Issue | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| CBO with 1 ad set | Unnecessary complexity | Convert to ABO or add ad sets |
| CBO with >5 ad sets | Budget too diluted | Consolidate to 2-4 ad sets |
| ABO on a scaling campaign with 3 similar ad sets | Missing algorithmic optimization | Test CBO conversion |
| CBO where one ad set gets >80% of spend | Audience size imbalance | Move small ad set to separate campaign or switch to ABO |

---

## Step 4: Ad Set Consolidation Analysis

### Learning Phase Viability

For each ad set, calculate:
- Weekly conversions (last 7 days)
- Projected weekly conversions at current velocity
- Budget per ad set (ABO: direct, CBO: estimated from spend share)
- Minimum viable budget = target CPA * 50 / 7 (daily budget needed for 50 weekly conversions)

### Consolidation Candidates

Flag ad sets that should be merged:

| Reason | Detection | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| <50 weekly conversions | Performance data | Merge with closest audience ad set |
| Overlapping audiences (>50%) | Targeting comparison | Merge into single broader ad set |
| Same targeting, different creative | Targeting identical | Merge (Meta will test creative within one ad set) |
| Budget too low (<10x CPA) | Budget / CPA calculation | Merge or increase budget |

### Consolidation Impact Estimate

For each proposed merge:
- Combined audience size
- Combined budget
- Projected weekly conversions at combined budget
- Will the combined ad set exit learning? (>50/week?)
- Estimated CPA impact (consolidation usually improves CPA by 10-20%)

---

## Step 5: Naming Convention Audit

### Compliance Check

Parse every campaign, ad set, and ad name against the naming convention templates from account-conventions.

**Campaign names:** `{objective}_{audience}_{geo}_{launch_date}`
- Check each token is present and valid
- Check token values match the allowed set

**Ad set names:** `{targeting}_{placement}_{bid_strategy}_{budget}`
- Verify targeting token accurately describes actual targeting
- Verify bid strategy token matches actual bid strategy

**Ad names:** `{creative_type}_{concept}_{variant}_{format}`
- Verify creative type token is accurate
- Check variant numbering is sequential

### Violations Report

| Entity | Name | Expected Pattern | Violation | Severity |
|--------|------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| Campaign | "Test Campaign 2" | {obj}_{aud}_{geo}_{date} | Missing all tokens | High |
| Ad Set | "LAL_AUTO_LCAP_D50" | Pattern match | None | Compliant |
| Ad | "video 1" | {type}_{concept}_{var}_{format} | Missing tokens | High |

### Compliance Score

- **Full compliance:** 100% of entities follow the convention
- **High compliance:** >80% follow the convention
- **Partial compliance:** 50-80% follow the convention
- **Non-compliant:** <50% follow the convention

Naming conventions enable automated parsing across the toolkit. Non-compliant names break segmentation in analyze-creative, audit-audiences, and other action skills.

---

## Step 6: Advantage+ Assessment

**Skip if `capabilities.has_advantage_plus` is false and no ASC campaigns exist.**

### ASC Status Check

- Is ASC running? If yes, how many ASC campaigns?
- ASC budget as % of total account budget
- ASC performance vs manual campaigns (CPA, ROAS, conversion volume)

### Should ASC Be Running?

| Maturity | Monthly Conversions | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Nascent | <100 | No -- insufficient data for ASC |
| Developing | 100-500 | Test with 10-20% of budget |
| Established | 500-2000 | Run alongside manual, 20-40% of budget |
| Advanced | 2000+ | Primary scaling vehicle, 40-60% of budget |

### ASC Structure Check

If ASC is active:
- Only 1 ASC campaign per product/market (Meta recommendation)
- Country targeting set correctly
- Existing customer budget cap configured
- Creative variety sufficient (6-10+ ads recommended)
- Performance vs manual campaigns CPA

### ASC Recommendation

Based on account maturity, conversion volume, and current ASC status:
- **Launch ASC:** If Established+ and not running ASC
- **Scale ASC:** If running with good results but budget share is low
- **Fix ASC:** If running but misconfigured (wrong customer cap, insufficient creative)
- **Keep Manual:** If Nascent/early Developing or insufficient conversion volume

```

---

## Error Handling

| Issue | Detection | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Cannot access campaign settings | MCP returns partial data | Fall back to insights data to infer structure. Ask user to confirm campaign objectives and budget types manually. |
| Naming conventions not configured | naming_conventions fields are defaults | Skip naming audit entirely. Note in report that naming conventions should be set up. Focus on structural and learning phase analysis. |
| Very large account (>50 campaigns) | Campaign count | Tier the analysis: audit active campaigns first, then paused. May need multiple MCP calls with pagination. |
| All campaigns are ASC | No manual structure to audit | Pivot to ASC-specific analysis: creative count, customer cap settings, budget distribution. Assess if manual campaigns should be added for testing. |
| Mixed objectives in one campaign | Campaign has ad sets with different optimization goals | Flag as structural error (this actually shouldn't be possible in Meta, but configurations can be confusing). Clarify with user. |
| Account just launched (<7 days) | Very few campaigns, minimal data | Skip consolidation analysis (too early). Focus on initial structure assessment vs recommended starting structure. |
