# Account Conventions Setup Questionnaire

Use this interactive guide to populate the account-conventions config for a new agency or client. Work through each phase sequentially. Skip phases that don't apply (e.g., Phase 7 if no catalog is connected).

## How to Use

Walk the client or account manager through each phase. After completing all phases, the answers map directly to fields in the SKILL.md config schema. Copy the completed YAML into the config and validate.

## After Completing the Questionnaire

1. Map each answer to the corresponding YAML field in the account-conventions SKILL.md config
2. Validate all fields pass the Config Validation Rules
3. Run a test analysis skill (e.g., [[meta-ads-campaign-diagnostics-methodology]]) to confirm the config loads correctly
4. Save the updated config to `meta-ads/account-conventions.yaml` in the project FileStore. If
   FileStore is unavailable, use MemoryStore when attached; otherwise return the YAML to the user.
