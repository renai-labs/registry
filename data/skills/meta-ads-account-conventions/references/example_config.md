# Example Configs

Two examples are provided:
1. **Single-brand setup** (Apex Athletics managing their own ads)
2. **Agency setup** (Full Funnel Growth managing Apex Athletics as a client)

Both produce the same analysis. The only difference is the organization identity section.

---

## Example 1: Single-Brand Media Buyer

Apex Athletics sells premium athletic apparel DTC. Their in-house media buyer manages two Meta ad accounts (US and UK).

```yaml
# ============================================================
# META ADS ANALYSIS TOOLKIT - ACCOUNT CONVENTIONS
# Brand: Apex Athletics (single-brand setup)
# Last updated: 2026-03-27
# ============================================================

organization:
  name: "Apex Athletics"
  slug: "apex-athletics"            # Used in report file names and UTM attribution
  type: "brand"                     # Single brand, not an agency
```

Everything else (accounts, KPIs, creative config, etc.) is identical to the agency example below. The only difference is `organization.type: "brand"` vs `"agency"`.

---

## Example 2: Agency Managing Client Accounts

Full Funnel Growth (agency) manages Apex Athletics as one of their clients.

```yaml
# ============================================================
# META ADS ANALYSIS TOOLKIT - ACCOUNT CONVENTIONS

## Key Differences Between Accounts

| Dimension | Apex US (Established) | Apex UK (Developing) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Monthly conversions | 180 | 45 |
| Monthly spend | $35,000 | GBP 8,000 |
| Primary KPI | ROAS (4x target) | CPA (GBP 28 target) |
| ASC enabled | Yes | No (insufficient volume) |
| VBO enabled | Yes | No (need 100+ conversions first) |
| Creative testing | DCT (Flexible Ads) | Manual A/B |
| Weekly creatives | 8 | 3 |
| Attribution window | 7d click + 1d view | 7d click only |
| Flag thresholds | Tighter (high confidence) | Looser (still learning) |
| Audience approach | Advantage+ default | Manual audience selection |
| GDPR | No (US only) | Yes (UK/EU) |
| CCPA | Yes (California) | No (UK only) |

## Why These Choices

**US account (established):** With 180 monthly conversions and $35K spend, this account has enough data to leverage Meta's machine learning fully. ASC, VBO, DCT, and Advantage+ Audience all benefit from high signal volume. Tighter flag thresholds catch issues faster because the data is statistically reliable.

**UK account (developing):** At 45 conversions/month, the algorithm needs more explicit guidance. Manual A/B testing prevents wasted spend on under-powered DCT experiments. CPA as primary KPI (instead of ROAS) provides a clearer optimization signal at lower volumes. Looser flag thresholds prevent false alarms from natural variance in small sample sizes.

This dual-account setup is common for brands expanding internationally. The US account playbook becomes the roadmap for the UK account as it matures.
