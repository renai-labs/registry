name: meta-ads-optimize-budgets
description: Optimizes budget allocation across Meta Ads campaigns. Produces reallocation tables with projected impact, scaling recommendations, and pacing analysis. Uses marginal efficiency modeling to shift budget from diminishing-return campaigns to constrained-efficient ones. Use when asked to optimize, reallocate, or review budgets, scale spend, analyze pacing, or decide where to spend more. Do NOT use for bid strategy or cost caps, which is [[meta-ads-audit-bidding]].

# Optimize Budgets

## How to Call Meta Ads Tools

Call the mounted `meta_ads_*` MCP tools directly. Do not write a Python wrapper.

Verify every entity field with `meta_ads_get_field_context`, then use
`meta_ads_get_ad_entities` with a numeric `ad_account_id` and fields containing `id` and `name`.
Use `meta_ads_update_entity` for approved budget changes. It mutates immediately; there is no
draft layer. Budget inputs use the smallest unit of the account currency.

## Purpose

Execute a data-driven budget optimization across all active campaigns in a Meta Ads account. This skill identifies which campaigns deserve more budget (constrained-efficient), which are experiencing diminishing returns (scale back), and which are experiments that should be isolated. It produces a reallocation table with projected impact, a scaling schedule for growth candidates, and a pacing analysis to catch delivery issues.

## When to Use

- Weekly budget review (standalone or as part of weekly review)
- When total budget is increasing and you need to decide where to allocate
- When CPA is rising and you suspect budget misallocation
- When some campaigns are spending easily while others underdeliver
- Before a scaling push (product launch, seasonal peak)
- When the client asks "where should I spend more?"

## Dependencies

| Skill | Why It's Needed |
|-------|----------------|
| [[meta-ads-account-conventions]] | Account config: KPI targets, monthly spend, reporting period |
| [[meta-ads-budget-methodology]] | Scaling rules (20% increments), marginal efficiency framework, three-tier classification |
| [[meta-ads-account-maturity-methodology]] | Maturity determines scaling aggressiveness and budget concentration rules |

---

## Step 0: Load Dependencies

1. **Read [[meta-ads-account-conventions]]** and extract for the target account:
   - `ad_account_id`, `currency`, `timezone`
   - `kpi_config` (primary KPI, targets, flag thresholds)
   - `monthly_spend` (total budget context)
   - `naming_conventions` (parse campaign type, audience, geo)
   - `capabilities.campaign_types_active`
   - `maturity_level`
   - `data_source.method`
   - `reporting.period` and `reporting.comparison`

2. **Read [[meta-ads-budget-methodology]]** and load:
   - Three-tier classification framework (Core Performer, Growth Candidate, Experiment)
   - Vertical scaling rules (20% every 3-4 days, never >2x in a week)
   - Horizontal scaling guidelines (new ad sets vs new campaigns)
   - Marginal efficiency modeling approach
   - CBO vs ABO budget management differences
   - Budget floor and ceiling guidelines

3. **Read [[meta-ads-account-maturity-methodology]]** and determine:
   - Scaling aggressiveness:
     - **Nascent:** Conservative, max 15% increases, focus on learning
     - **Developing:** Moderate, 20% increases, test new campaigns at 10-15% of total
     - **Established:** Aggressive, 20-30% increases on proven campaigns, 15-20% for tests
     - **Advanced:** Aggressive scaling with sophisticated marginal efficiency tracking

**Validation gate:** If no KPI targets are set, budget optimization cannot determine "efficient" vs "inefficient." Prompt the user to set CPA/ROAS targets.

### CSV Fallback

If data_source.method = "csv":
1. Campaign-level report, last 14 days, daily breakdown, include Budget and Delivery columns
2. Ad set-level report, last 7 days, daily breakdown, include Budget column
3. Campaign settings export (budget type, daily/lifetime budget, bid strategy)

---

## Step 2: Pacing Analysis

Pacing measures how effectively each campaign is deploying its budget.

### Daily Pacing Calculation

For each campaign, calculate:
- **Daily budget** (from campaign config or sum of ad set budgets for ABO)
- **Average daily spend** (total spend / days in period)
- **Pacing ratio** = average daily spend / daily budget
- **Trend** = last 3-day average vs prior 3-day average

### Pacing Classification

| Pacing Ratio | Classification | Interpretation |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| >95% | Constrained | Campaign wants to spend more. If CPA is within target, this is a scale candidate. |
| 80-95% | Healthy | Normal delivery range. Budget is approximately right. |
| 50-80% | Underdelivering | Campaign cannot find enough efficient impressions. Possible causes: targeting too narrow, bid/cap too tight, creative fatigue. |
| <50% | Severely Underdelivering | Something is wrong. Check bid strategy, audience size, creative approval status, learning phase. |
| N/A (lifetime) | Lifetime Budget | Calculate remaining budget / remaining days for effective daily rate. |

### Constrained-Efficient Identification

The most valuable finding: campaigns that are **constrained AND efficient**.
- Pacing ratio >95% (wants more budget)
- CPA within or below target
- These campaigns would generate more conversions with more budget at acceptable CPA
- Flag these prominently as immediate scaling opportunities

### Underdelivery Diagnosis

For underdelivering campaigns, diagnose the cause:

| Signal | Likely Cause | Recommended Action |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Low impressions + high CPA | Audience too small or exhausted | Expand targeting (see audit-audiences) |
| Low impressions + cost cap active | Cost cap too tight | Raise cap by 10-20% |
| Impressions OK but low clicks | Creative not resonating | Run analyze-creative |
| In learning phase | Not enough conversion signal | Increase budget or consolidate ad sets |
| Declining spend trend | Creative fatigue or audience saturation | Check frequency and CTR trends |

---

## Step 3: Marginal Efficiency Analysis

Determine each campaign's marginal efficiency -- the cost of the NEXT conversion, not the average.

### Method: Incremental CPA Estimation

Using daily data, model the relationship between spend and conversions:

1. **Plot daily spend vs daily CPA** for each campaign over the 14-day window
2. **Identify the inflection point** where CPA starts rising with spend (diminishing returns)
3. **Classify efficiency zone:**

| Zone | CPA Behavior as Spend Increases | Implication |
|------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **Linear** | CPA stays flat or decreases | Safe to scale -- more budget = proportionally more conversions |
| **Inflecting** | CPA starts rising (5-15% above baseline on high-spend days) | Near the efficiency frontier. Scale carefully (10-15% increments) |
| **Diminishing** | CPA rises >15% above baseline on high-spend days | Past the efficiency frontier. Reallocate budget to Linear-zone campaigns |
| **Accelerating** | CPA is declining as spend increases | Rare. Campaign is learning and improving. Scale aggressively. |

### Simplified Approach (if daily variance is too high)

When daily CPA variance makes regression unreliable (common in lower-spend campaigns):
1. Compare 7-day periods: did CPA rise when spend rose?
2. Use conversion volume as a proxy: campaigns with >10 conversions/day are likely in the Linear zone
3. Flag low-volume campaigns (<3 conversions/day) as "insufficient data for marginal analysis"

### Marginal Efficiency Ranking

Rank all campaigns from most efficient marginal dollar to least:

| Rank | Campaign | Avg CPA | Marginal CPA (est.) | Efficiency Zone | Daily Budget | Recommended Change |
|------|----------|---------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1    | ...      | $42     | $40                 | Linear          | $200        | +$50 (+25%)       |
| 2    | ...      | $55     | $58                 | Inflecting      | $300        | +$30 (+10%)       |
| ...  | ...      | $78     | $95                 | Diminishing     | $500        | -$100 (-20%)      |

---

## Step 4: Three-Tier Classification

Classify each campaign into one of three tiers (from budget-methodology):

### Core Performer
- CPA within target
- Pacing >80%
- Stable or improving trend
- Has been running 14+ days with consistent results
- **Budget rule:** 60-70% of total account budget across all Core campaigns

### Growth Candidate
- CPA within 130% of target
- Shows potential (improving trend or newly graduated from learning)
- Running 7-14 days with directionally positive signals
- **Budget rule:** 20-30% of total account budget across all Growth campaigns

### Experiment
- New concept, audience, or creative being tested
- Less than 7 days of data OR CPA above 130% of target but intentionally exploring
- **Budget rule:** 10-15% of total account budget, isolated from Core campaigns
- Kill criteria: spend >3x target CPA with zero conversions

### Classification Table

| Campaign | Tier | CPA vs Target | Pacing | Trend | Days Active | Budget Share |
|----------|------|---------------|--------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| ...      | Core | 92% (-8%)    | 97%    | Stable | 45          | 35%         |

### Budget Concentration Check

- If >80% of budget is in Core: account may be under-testing. Recommend shifting 5-10% to Experiments.
- If >30% is in Experiments: too much budget at risk. Graduate or kill experiments faster.
- If Core campaigns represent <50% of budget: account is under-capitalizing proven winners.

---

## Step 5: Scaling Plan

For campaigns identified as scale candidates (Core Performers with constrained pacing), build a scaling schedule.

### Vertical Scaling Rules (from budget-methodology)

- **Maximum single increase:** 20% of current daily budget
- **Frequency:** Every 3-4 days (allow 72h for algorithm adjustment)
- **Never exceed:** 2x original budget in a single week
- **Monitor after each increase:** 48 hours before the next decision

### Scaling Schedule Builder

For each scale candidate:

```
Campaign: {name}
Current daily budget: ${current}
Target daily budget: ${target} (based on marginal efficiency headroom)

Day 0: ${current} (baseline)
Day 3: ${current * 1.20} (+20%)
  - Monitor: CPA within 15% of baseline? Continue.
  - Rollback: CPA >30% above baseline for 48h? Revert.
Day 6: ${current * 1.20 * 1.20} (+44% from baseline)
  - Monitor: Same criteria.
Day 9: ${current * 1.20 * 1.20 * 1.20} (+73% from baseline)
  - Checkpoint: Full assessment. Continue scaling or stabilize?
```

### Horizontal Scaling (When to Use)

Vertical scaling has limits. When a campaign hits diminishing returns at its ceiling:
- **Duplicate the campaign** with a different audience segment
- **Launch new creative** in the existing campaign (Faris method)
- **Split by geo** (if running multi-geo in one campaign)
- **ASC addition** (run an Advantage+ campaign alongside manual campaigns)

---

## Step 6: Reallocation Table

The core deliverable: where to move budget from/to, with projected impact.

### Reallocation Methodology

1. **Identify sources** (campaigns to decrease): Diminishing efficiency zone, high CPA, underdelivering
2. **Identify destinations** (campaigns to increase): Constrained-efficient, Linear zone, proven performers
3. **Calculate projected impact:**
   - Freed budget from source = decrease amount
   - Projected conversions lost = decrease amount / source marginal CPA
   - Projected conversions gained = increase amount / destination marginal CPA
   - Net conversion impact = gained - lost
   - Net CPA impact on total account

### Reallocation Constraints

- Never decrease a campaign's budget by >30% in one move (learning phase risk)
- Never increase a campaign's budget by >20% in one move (performance volatility risk)
- Ensure every Core campaign retains at least a "minimum viable budget" (10x target CPA daily)
- Reallocation should be budget-neutral unless the user is adding new budget

---

## Checkpoint: Present Reallocation Plan

```
Budget Optimization Summary for {account_name}
Period: {date_range}
Total Daily Budget: ${total}
Total Daily Spend: ${actual} ({utilization}% utilization)

Tier Distribution:
- Core Performers: {count} campaigns, ${amount}/day ({pct}%)
- Growth Candidates: {count} campaigns, ${amount}/day ({pct}%)
- Experiments: {count} campaigns, ${amount}/day ({pct}%)

Key Findings:
- Constrained-efficient campaigns (scale candidates): {count}
  Combined daily budget headroom: ~${amount}
- Diminishing-return campaigns (reallocation sources): {count}
  Recoverable daily budget: ~${amount}
- Underdelivering campaigns: {count}

Proposed Reallocation:
| From | Amount | To | Amount | Net CPA Impact |
|------|--------|-----|--------|----------------|
| ... | -$X | ... | +$X | -${improvement} |

Projected total impact:
- Conversions: +{count} per day (+{pct}%)
- Blended CPA: from ${current} to ${projected} ({change}%)
- Daily spend: ${current} to ${projected}

Shall I generate the full reallocation table and scaling schedule?
```

## Step 7: Output Generation

### Deliverable 1: Reallocation Table

```markdown
# Budget Reallocation Plan: {account_name}
Generated: {date} | Period: {date_range}
Budget Constraint: {budget-neutral / adding ${amount} / reducing ${amount}}

## Reallocation Summary
| # | From Campaign | Decrease | To Campaign | Increase | Rationale |
|---|--------------|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | CONV_PROS_EU | -$100/day | CONV_PROS_US | +$100/day | EU hitting diminishing returns (marginal CPA $95), US constrained at $45 CPA |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Projected Impact
| Metric | Current (7d avg) | Projected | Change |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Daily conversions | {current} | {projected} | +{pct}% |
| Blended CPA | ${current} | ${projected} | {change}% |
| Daily spend | ${current} | ${projected} | {change}% |
| ROAS | {current}x | {projected}x | {change}% |

## Implementation Notes
- Execute reallocations in the order listed (lowest risk first)
- Make changes between 6-9 AM account timezone (low-traffic hours)
- Wait 24 hours between each reallocation to observe impact
- Do not change bid strategy simultaneously (one variable at a time)
```

### Deliverable 2: Scaling Schedule

```markdown
## Scaling Schedule
For campaigns receiving budget increases.

### {Campaign Name}
| Date | Daily Budget | Change | Cumulative | Monitor |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Mar 28 | $200 | Baseline | -- | Record CPA: $__ |
| Mar 31 | $240 | +$40 (+20%) | +20% | CPA within 15% of baseline? |
| Apr 3 | $290 | +$50 (+21%) | +45% | CPA check, conversion volume check |
| Apr 6 | $350 | +$60 (+21%) | +75% | Full assessment: continue or stabilize |

**Rollback trigger:** CPA >30% above baseline for 48 consecutive hours
**Success criteria:** CPA within 20% of baseline at new spend level for 5+ days
```

### Deliverable 3: Before/After Projections

```markdown
## Before/After Budget Allocation

### Current State
| Campaign | Tier | Daily Budget | Daily Spend | CPA | Conversions/Day | Pacing |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|-----|----------------|--------|
| ... | Core | $500 | $480 | $48 | 10 | 96% |

### Projected State (After Reallocation)
| Campaign | Tier | New Budget | Proj. Spend | Proj. CPA | Proj. Conv/Day | Change |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| ... | Core | $600 | $570 | $50 | 11.4 | +14% conv |

### Account-Level Before/After
| Metric | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Total daily budget | ${total} | ${total} | $0 (neutral) |
| Total daily conversions | {conv} | {conv} | +{delta} |
| Blended CPA | ${cpa} | ${cpa} | {delta}% |
| Total daily revenue (if ROAS tracked) | ${rev} | ${rev} | +{delta}% |
```

---

## Error Handling

| Issue | Detection | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Mix of CBO and ABO campaigns | Budget set at different levels | Analyze CBO at campaign level, ABO at ad set level. Present both views. |
| Lifetime budgets present | Some campaigns use lifetime budget, not daily | Convert to effective daily rate: remaining_budget / remaining_days. Note reduced flexibility for scaling. |
| Very few campaigns (<3) | Limited reallocation options | Focus on vertical scaling and pacing analysis. Recommend adding new campaigns for diversification. |
| All campaigns underdelivering | Nothing to reallocate from | Root cause is not budget allocation -- likely bid strategy, audience, or creative issue. Recommend running audit-bidding and analyze-creative first. |
| No conversion data | CPA cannot be calculated | Fall back to CPM/CPC efficiency for budget allocation. Note that this is a weaker signal. Recommend running audit-measurement. |
| Huge CPA variance | Daily CPA swings make marginal analysis unreliable | Use weekly aggregates instead of daily. Note reduced precision in marginal efficiency estimates. |
| Single campaign accounts | Nothing to reallocate between | Focus on ad set-level budget distribution within the campaign. Recommend launching additional campaigns for testing. |

---

## Execution Capability

After generating the reallocation table and scaling schedule, this skill can propose budget
changes for human approval. No budget changes execute automatically.

### Execution vs Analysis

| Action | Execution Method | Requires Human Approval? |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Update campaign daily or lifetime budget | `meta_ads_update_entity` with `entity_type: "campaign"` and campaign budget fields | Yes -- present exact mutation first |
| Update ad set daily or lifetime budget | `meta_ads_update_entity` with `entity_type: "adset"` and ad-set budget fields | Yes -- present exact mutation first |
| Read campaign/ad set performance data | `meta_ads_get_ad_entities` | No approval needed (read-only) |

### Scaling Safety Rule

Never increase a budget by more than 20% in a single change. Changes larger than 20% signal a significant shift to Meta's algorithm and can reset the learning phase, causing CPA to spike for 3-7 days.

- If the scaling schedule calls for a large increase, break it into 20% increments spaced 3-4 days apart.
- This rule applies to both campaign-level (CBO) and ad set-level (ABO) budgets.
- Decreases: similarly, never decrease by more than 30% in one move.

### Step 7 Addition: Proposed Budget Changes Queue

After the reallocation table is generated and confirmed by the user, produce a proposed change
queue in implementation order. Present for approval before executing.

```
