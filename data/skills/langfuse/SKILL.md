description: Interact with Langfuse and access its documentation. Use when needing to (1) query or modify Langfuse data programmatically via the CLI — traces, prompts, datasets, scores, sessions, and any other API resource, (2) look up Langfuse documentation, concepts, integration guides, or SDK usage, or (3) understand how any Langfuse feature works. This skill covers CLI-based API access (via npx) and multiple documentation retrieval methods.

# Langfuse

This skill helps you use Langfuse effectively across all common workflows: instrumenting applications, migrating prompts, debugging traces, and accessing data programmatically.

## Core Principles

Follow these principles for ALL Langfuse work:

1. **Documentation First**: NEVER implement based on memory. Always fetch current docs before writing code (Langfuse updates frequently) See the section below on how to access documentation.
2. **CLI for Data Access**: Use `langfuse-cli` when querying/modifying Langfuse data. See the section below on how to use the CLI. 
3. **Best Practices by Use Case**: Check the relevant reference file below for use-case-specific guidelines before implementing
4. **Use latest Langfuse versions**: Unless the user specified otherwise or there's a good reason, always use the latest version of Langfuse SDKs/APIs.


## Use case specific references

- instrumenting an existing function/application: references/instrumentation.md
- migrating prompts from a codebase into Langfuse: references/prompt-migration.md
- capturing user feedback (thumbs, ratings, implicit signals) as scores on traces: references/user-feedback.md
- further tips on using the Langfuse CLI: references/cli.md
- judge calibration (LLM-as-a-Judge reliability, simple accuracy checks, advanced split-based validation, confusion matrices, and metric ingestion): references/judge-calibration.md
- systematic error analysis — reading traces, building failure taxonomy, deciding what to fix: references/error-analysis.md


## 1. Langfuse API via CLI

Use the `langfuse-cli` to interact with the full Langfuse REST API from the command line. Run via npx (no install required):

Start by discovering the schema and available arguments:

```bash
# Discover all available resources
npx langfuse-cli api __schema

# List actions for a resource
npx langfuse-cli api <resource> --help

# Show args/options for a specific action
npx langfuse-cli api <resource> <action> --help
```

### Credentials

The skill reads `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, and `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` (the server must always be specified — EU cloud `https://cloud.langfuse.com`, US cloud `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`, or a self-hosted URL).

_Credentials are provided in the environment — the skill reads them at the call site._

### Detailed CLI Reference

For common workflows, tips, and full usage patterns, see [references/cli.md](references/cli.md).

## 2. Langfuse Documentation

Three methods to access Langfuse docs, in order of preference. **Always prefer the agent's native web fetch and search tools** over `curl` when available. The URLs and patterns below work with any fetching method — the `curl` examples are just illustrative.

### 2a. Documentation Index (llms.txt)

Fetch the full index of all documentation pages:

```bash
curl -s https://langfuse.com/llms.txt
```

Returns a structured list of every doc page with titles and URLs. Use this to discover the right page for a topic, then fetch that page directly.

Alternatively, you can start on `https://langfuse.com/docs` and explore the site to find the page you need.

### 2b. Fetch Individual Pages as Markdown

Any page listed in llms.txt can be fetched as markdown by appending `.md` to its path or by using `Accept: text/markdown` in the request headers. Use this when you know which page contains the information needed. Returns clean markdown with code examples and configuration details.

```bash
curl -s "https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/overview.md"
curl -s "https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/overview" -H "Accept: text/markdown"
```

### 2c. Search Documentation

When you need to find information across all docs and github issues/discussions without knowing the specific page:

```bash
curl -s "https://langfuse.com/api/search-docs?query=<url-encoded-query>"
```

Example:

```bash
curl -s "https://langfuse.com/api/search-docs?query=How+do+I+trace+LangGraph+agents"
```

Returns a JSON response with:

- `query`: the original query
- `answer`: a JSON string containing an array of matching documents, each with:
  - `url`: link to the doc page
  - `title`: page title
  - `source.content`: array of relevant text excerpts from the page

Search is a great fallback if you cannot find the relevant pages or need more context. Especially useful when debugging issues as all GitHub Issues and Discussions are also indexed. Responses can be large — extract only the relevant portions.

### Documentation Workflow

1. Start with **llms.txt** to orient — scan for relevant page titles
2. **Fetch specific pages** when you identify the right one
3. Fall back to **search** when the topic is unclear and you want more context
