# Exclusion Architecture - Multi-Layer Exclusion Strategy

## Why Exclusions Matter

Without exclusions, you pay to acquire people who are already your customers. You also pollute your campaign data -- conversion events from existing customers inflate your reported performance, leading to bad budget decisions.

## The Three-Layer Exclusion Model

### Layer 1: Pixel-Based Exclusions (Highest Match Rate)

Pixel exclusions cover only users Meta can associate with the relevant browser event and audience
window. Consent, browser controls, identity matching, event loss, and audience processing prevent a
100% guarantee.

**Setup:**
1. Create Custom Audience > Website
2. Select the conversion event (e.g., Purchase, CompleteRegistration)
3. Set lookback window (typically 180 days)
4. Add as exclusion in your prospecting ad sets

**Recommended pixel exclusions:**

| Exclusion Audience | Lookback | Apply To |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| Purchase event | 180 days | All prospecting campaigns |
| CompleteRegistration event | 90 days | All prospecting campaigns |
| InitiateCheckout event | 30 days | Top-of-funnel prospecting only |
| AddToCart event | 14 days | Top-of-funnel prospecting only |

**Limitations:**
- Only captures browser-based events (not app, not offline)
- Cookie blocking and ITP reduce match over time
- 180-day maximum lookback

### Layer 2: Customer List Exclusions (Broadest Coverage)

Upload your customer list to exclude known customers across all devices and browsers.

**Setup:**
1. Create Custom Audience > Customer List
2. Upload CSV with email, phone, name (more fields = better match)
3. Meta hashes and matches against user profiles
4. Add as exclusion in prospecting ad sets

**Recommended list exclusions:**

| List | Update Frequency | Apply To |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| All paying customers | Weekly | All prospecting campaigns |
| All registered users | Weekly | All prospecting campaigns |
| Active trial users | Daily (if possible) | Prospecting (unless upselling) |
| Churned customers (recent) | Monthly | Prospecting (optional -- you may want to win them back) |

**Match rate reality:**
- Email-only lists: 30-50% match
- This means 50-70% of your customers are NOT being excluded
- Accept this limitation. Layer 2 + Layer 1 combined covers more than either alone.

### Layer 3: Engagement-Based Exclusions (Supplementary)

Exclude people who have already engaged with your content in meaningful ways.

**Setup:**
- Create engagement Custom Audiences
- Add as exclusions where appropriate

**Recommended engagement exclusions:**

| Exclusion | Apply To | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Lead form submitters (90 days) | Prospecting (lead gen) | Already in your pipeline |
| Instagram/FB page followers | Optional | May want to exclude from cold prospecting |
| Video viewers (95%, 365 days) | Optional | High awareness, may convert organically |

## Exclusion Architecture by Campaign Type

### Prospecting Campaign

```
Exclusions:
├── Layer 1: Pixel
│   ├── Purchase event (180 days)
│   ├── CompleteRegistration event (90 days)
│   └── Lead event (90 days) [if lead gen]
├── Layer 2: Customer List
│   ├── All paying customers
│   └── All registered/trial users
└── Layer 3: Engagement (optional)
    └── Lead form submitters (90 days) [if lead gen]
```

### Retargeting Campaign

```
Inclusions:
├── Website visitors (7-30 days)
├── Video viewers (50%+, 30 days)
├── Lead form openers (30 days)
└── Instagram/FB engagers (30 days)

Exclusions:
├── Layer 1: Pixel
│   ├── Purchase event (180 days)
│   └── CompleteRegistration event (30 days) [if SaaS signup = conversion]
└── Layer 2: Customer List
    └── All paying customers
```

### Retention/Upsell Campaign

```
Inclusions:
├── Customer list (paying customers only)
└── Purchase pixel event (180 days)

Exclusions:
├── Recent purchasers (7-14 days) [avoid buyer's remorse]
├── Churned customers [if targeting active users only]
└── Customers on highest tier [if upselling]
```

### Advantage+ Shopping Campaign (ASC)

ASC has a special exclusion mechanism:
- **Existing Customer Budget Cap:** Set to 0-10% to limit retargeting spend
- Upload your customer list in the ASC settings for Meta to identify existing customers
- This doesn't fully exclude them but limits their share of budget

## Common Exclusion Mistakes

### Mistake 1: No exclusions at all
**Impact:** 10-30% of prospecting budget wasted on existing customers
**Fix:** Implement Layer 1 + Layer 2 immediately

### Mistake 2: Only using customer list (no pixel)
**Impact:** 50-70% of customers slip through due to low match rates
**Fix:** Add pixel-based exclusions. Together they catch 70-90%.

### Mistake 3: Too-short lookback window
**Impact:** Customers who converted 60+ days ago re-enter prospecting
**Fix:** Use 180-day lookback for pixel exclusions, update customer lists weekly

### Mistake 4: Excluding from retargeting
**Impact:** Retargeting audience becomes too small, can't exit learning phase
**Fix:** Only exclude actual converters from retargeting, not "might be interested" audiences

### Mistake 5: Over-excluding from ASC
**Impact:** ASC needs some existing customer data to understand your ideal buyer
**Fix:** Use the budget cap (5-10%), don't hard-exclude

### Mistake 6: Never updating customer lists
**Impact:** New customers keep getting prospecting ads
**Fix:** Weekly or bi-weekly list uploads. Automate if possible (Zapier, direct integration).

## Exclusion Verification

### How to Verify Exclusions Are Working

1. **Check audience size:** After adding exclusions, the ad set's potential reach should decrease
2. **Audience Overlap tool:** Compare your exclusion audience against your targeting audience
3. **Breakdown by "DMA region" or demographics:** If you see unusual patterns, exclusions may not be matching
4. **Monitor new vs returning customer ratio:** If existing customers are still converting from prospecting, exclusions are leaking

### Expected Leakage

Even with perfect exclusion setup, expect 5-15% leakage (existing customers seeing prospecting ads) because:
- Customer list match rates are imperfect
- Users on new devices or browsers aren't matched by pixel
- Cookie expiration reduces pixel audience over time
- Cross-device usage creates gaps

**This is normal.** The goal is to minimize waste, not eliminate it entirely. A 5-15% leakage rate is acceptable. Above 20% warrants investigation.
