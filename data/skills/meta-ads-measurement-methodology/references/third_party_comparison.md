# Third-Party Attribution Tool Comparison

## Why Third-Party Attribution Exists

Every ad platform is a self-attributing network (SAN). Meta claims credit for conversions. Google claims credit for conversions. When you add up all platform-reported conversions, the total exceeds your actual revenue -- often by 30-60%. Third-party attribution tools solve this by providing an independent, de-duplicated view across all platforms.

## Using Third-Party Data Effectively

### Setting Up Your Source of Truth

1. **Install the third-party tool** alongside Meta Pixel and CAPI
2. **Let it calibrate** for 14-30 days before making decisions
3. **Compare:** Meta reported CPA vs third-party CPA for the same period
4. **Calculate the "discount factor":** If Meta says CPA is $30 and third-party says $45, the discount is 1.5x
5. **Apply the discount** when evaluating Meta campaigns: if Meta reports $40 CPA, actual is likely ~$60

### The "Two Dashboard" Approach

- **Dashboard 1: Meta Ads Manager** - for campaign optimization (creative, audience, bid decisions)
- **Dashboard 2: Third-party tool** - for budget allocation (how much to spend on Meta vs Google vs other)

**Why two dashboards?** Meta's algorithm optimizes based on its own data. If you make creative/audience changes based on third-party data, you're fighting the algorithm. Use Meta's data to optimize Meta. Use third-party data to decide how much to give Meta.

### Reconciliation Process

Monthly reconciliation between Meta reported and third-party:

| Metric | Meta Reported | Third-Party | Variance | Action |
|--------|--------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Conversions | 500 | 380 | -24% | Normal range (Meta over-reports) |
| Revenue | $50,000 | $42,000 | -16% | Third-party is source of truth |
| CPA | $40 | $53 | +33% | Budget decisions use $53 |
| ROAS | 5.0x | 4.2x | -16% | Third-party is source of truth |

**Expected variance:** Meta over-reports by 15-40% vs third-party tools. If variance is >50%, investigate data quality issues.

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Implementation

- [ ] Decide which tool based on business type and spend level
- [ ] Get team buy-in (changing measurement changes reported numbers -- prepare stakeholders)
- [ ] Clean up UTM structure (third-party tools rely on UTMs)
- [ ] Verify all conversion events fire correctly (Pixel + CAPI)

### Implementation

- [ ] Install third-party tracking pixel/script
- [ ] Connect ad platform APIs (Meta, Google, etc.)
- [ ] Configure conversion events in the tool
- [ ] Set attribution window to match your Meta settings
- [ ] Configure UTM auto-detection
- [ ] Set up daily/weekly email reports

### Calibration (First 14-30 Days)

- [ ] Data flowing correctly from all platforms
- [ ] Conversion counts reasonable (not wildly different from Meta)
- [ ] CRM data matching (if using Hyros)
- [ ] Team trained on the dashboard
- [ ] Source of truth established and communicated

### Ongoing

- [ ] Weekly: Compare Meta reported vs third-party
- [ ] Monthly: Reconciliation analysis
- [ ] Quarterly: Review if the tool is still the right fit
- [ ] When scaling: Verify the tool handles increased volume
