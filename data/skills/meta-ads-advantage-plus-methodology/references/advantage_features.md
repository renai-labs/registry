## Ad Set-Level Features

### Advantage+ Audience

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it does** | Replaces traditional detailed targeting. Your targeting inputs become "suggestions" the algorithm uses as starting signals, not restrictions |
| **How it differs from legacy** | Legacy: interests/behaviors are hard restrictions. A+ Audience: they're directional suggestions the algorithm may expand beyond |
| **Inputs you can provide** | Custom Audiences, Lookalike seeds, interests, demographics, locations |
| **How expansion works** | Meta uses your suggestions to understand the type of user you want, then finds additional users who match the pattern |
| **Control level** | Low-Medium (you influence direction, Meta decides reach) |
| **Best for** | Most campaigns, especially with 200+ monthly conversions |
| **Not recommended for** | Very narrow B2B (<100K TAM), special ad categories requiring strict targeting |
| **Location handling** | Geographic targeting is respected more strictly than other suggestions |

### Advantage+ Placements

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it does** | Automatically distributes ads across all available placements (Feed, Stories, Reels, Right Column, Audience Network, etc.) |
| **Default** | ON by default for new ad sets |
| **How it works** | Meta's algorithm bids across all placements and allocates budget to where it finds the cheapest effective impressions |
| **Performance benefit** | 10-15% lower CPA on average vs manual placement selection |
| **When to override** | Video-only campaigns, Stories-specific creative, Audience Network exclusion, desktop-only products |
| **Creative requirement** | Provide multiple aspect ratios (1:1, 4:5, 9:16) for best results |

### Advantage Detailed Targeting

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it does** | Expands your detailed targeting (interests/behaviors) beyond your selections to reach additional users likely to convert |
| **Status** | Being replaced by Advantage+ Audience in most new ad sets |
| **Default** | ON by default for conversion-optimized campaigns |
| **How it differs from A+ Audience** | A+ Detailed Targeting is a toggle on existing targeting; A+ Audience is a full replacement of the targeting system |
| **When to disable** | If expansion CPA is significantly worse than core audience CPA (check Delivery Insights) |

### Advantage Lookalike

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **What it does** | Allows Meta to expand beyond your selected lookalike percentage to find additional convertible users |
| **Example** | You select 1% lookalike; Meta may expand to 3-5% if it finds efficient conversions there |
| **Default** | ON for most new ad sets |
| **When to disable** | If you need strict audience control or are testing lookalike sizes specifically |
