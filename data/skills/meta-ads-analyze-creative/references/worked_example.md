## Step 3: Fatigue Detection

**VID_TESTIMON_V2_9x16:**
- CTR: 1.40% current vs 1.58% prior = -11.4% (Warning: >10% decline)
- CPA: $41.20 current vs $36.80 prior = +11.9% (Below 15% threshold, monitoring)
- Frequency: 2.8 (Warning: >2.5 for prospecting)
- Classification: **Early Warning** (2 warning signals)

**STATIC_OFFER_V1_1x1:**
- CTR: 0.80% current vs 0.95% prior = -15.8% (Warning)
- CPA: $63.75 current vs $52.00 prior = +22.6% (Warning: >15%)
- Frequency: 1.9 (Healthy)
- Classification: **Active Fatigue** (2 warning signals, CPA significantly above target)

**CAROUSEL_BENEFIT_V1 (Retargeting):**
- Frequency: 4.2 (Below retargeting warning of 5.0, but worth monitoring)
- CTR: stable
- Classification: **Healthy** (retargeting thresholds are higher)

All other ads: **Healthy**

## Step 4: Format Analysis

| Format | Ads | Spend (7d) | Avg CPA | Avg CTR | Hook Rate | Win Rate |
|--------|-----|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Video | 6 | $3,550 | $39.50 | 1.44% | 36% | 67% |
| Static | 3 | $1,020 | $58.75 | 0.97% | N/A | 0% |
| UGC | 1 | $290 | $48.30 | 1.40% | 40% | 0% |
| Carousel | 1 | $210 | $26.25 | 1.30% | N/A | 100% |

**Finding:** Video outperforms static by 33% on CPA. Static ads are significantly underperforming. UGC has only 1 ad (underexplored).

**Format mix vs recommended (SaaS/B2B from methodology):**
- Video: 68% of spend (recommended: 30% UGC + 25% founder = 55%) -- overweight but performing
- Static: 20% of spend (recommended: 20%) -- on target but underperforming
- UGC: 6% of spend (recommended: 30%) -- significantly underrepresented
- Carousel: 4% of spend (recommended: 10%) -- underrepresented

---

## Step 5: Testing Analysis

- Ads launched in last 7 days: 2 (VID_DEMO_V2, VID_TESTIMON_V3)
- Weekly target: 5 ads
- Velocity: 40% of target (below expectations)

- Win rate (last 30 days): 1 winner out of 4 tests = 25% (above 15-20% benchmark)

- Missing concepts: Comparison (us vs alternatives), Before/After, Myth-busting

---

## Step 6: Outputs Generated

All four deliverables produced with the data above. Key recommendations:

1. **Scale VID_FOUNDER_V1** -- increase budget 20%, create 3 more variants with hook swaps
2. **Pause STATIC_OFFER_V1** -- CPA 42% above target, active fatigue, static format underperforming
3. **Brief 3 UGC concepts** -- format is underrepresented at 6% of spend vs 30% recommended
4. **Increase testing velocity** -- at 40% of target, need 3 more ads next week
5. **Monitor VID_TESTIMON_V2** -- early fatigue warning, prepare replacement testimonial
6. **Test comparison angle** -- no us-vs-them creative in rotation
